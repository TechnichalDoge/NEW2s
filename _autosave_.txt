Dist2 = vec2(Locality):length() # gets the distance in only the x and y points by getting the length of the vector 2 form of the vector ( doing vec2(vector) drops the z value)

Size = vec(15,15,Distance) #We know the distance between the two, we would like the holo or whatever to span that distance ( if rotated )

Angles = ang( atan(Locality:z()/Dist2)#[gets the arc tangent of the tangent of the Distance between x and y and the local z]#, atan(Locality:y()/Locality:x())#[gets the arc tangent of the tangent of the local x and y]#,0)

arctangent is the inverse of tangent
tangent(angle) = y/x
arctangent(y/x) = angle
