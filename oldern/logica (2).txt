#Timer works like this. timer("timer name", time)
#The timer name is like the e2 name, it doesn't matter what its called
#all the timer on line 2 is saying is, every 30000 milliseconds the timer named "trigger" is activated.
#On line 3 we look for that timer to be activated, and if it is we concmd say /me for exalted
